Nasa successfully tests engines for Mars

Yesterday, NASA successfully tested its Space Launch System (SLS) RS-25 development engine 0528 at their Mississippi-based Stennis Space Centre. The engine ran for 420 seconds, over power ranges from 80 to 111 percent power level.

Testing in the RS-25 Development Engine began last year and have currently run for 5468 seconds, with the 0528 engine clocking 1263 seconds.

As a nation of explorers, we constantly look beyond the horizon, and Mars is the most logical place for humanity to expand our knowledge of the solar system...SLS, powered by four RS-25 engines, is just one of the six essential elements needed for an affordable journey to Mars. - Aerojet Rocketdyne CEO and President Eileen Drake.

Aerojet Rocketdyne is a major supporter of the six elements of the Mars Missions, allowing Nasa to create a viable solution for all Mars Missions and currently managing the testing for the RS-25 rocket engines and the current Delta IV Rocket.
