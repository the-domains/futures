China eyes a 2020 launch alongside Nasa

China, in recent years, has been aggressively pushing their presence in Space, and today the CNSA (China National Space Administration) have previewed a computer-generated image of their landed for the first time.

The six-wheeled rover is equipped with 13 different instruments, including a radar that can drill into the ground and a remote-sensing camera, to take a closer look at the Martian soil and environment. The lander is designed for a three-month mission, however, like its predecessor, this is likely to continue for longer.

2020 is a busy year for Mars missions, due to its orbital position with the earth and Nasa is also launching their Mars 2020 rover.
