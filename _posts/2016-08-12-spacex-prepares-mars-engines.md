SpaceX enters engine testing stage for Red Dragon

SpaceX officially enters testing phase for Red Dragon Missions with the engines being sent to its McGregor, Texas Facility for testing. The Red Dragon engines unleash 3 times the power of the current engines and are expected to launch for the first time in 2018\.

The 'Raptor' engines, as they are known, will power the successor of the Falcon Heavy, currently being designed to build the MCT (Mars Colonial Transporter). The Raptor Engines will produce 500,000 pounds of thrust at liftoff. 3 times the power of the Falcon 9 & Falcon Heavy, and on par with the Space Shuttle.

SpaceX current plans for Red Dragon missions start in 2018 with a soft landing on the red planet, and a manned mission by 2024\. 

Updates on the Raptor, MCT & Red Dragon are expected to be unveiled in the next few months.
