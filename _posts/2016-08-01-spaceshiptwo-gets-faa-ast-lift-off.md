SpaceShipTwo gets lift off!

Virgin Galactic has been very quiet in recent days, since the October 2014 crash that killed copilot Michael Aslbury. However, today Virgin Galactic announced they have been awarded their operations license for SpaceShipTwo.

The FAA-AST review process consists of an in-depth review of the vehicle design, safety analysis and flight trajectory; all successfully passed the approval.

Virgin Galactic SVP of operations Mike Moses said

> The granting of our operator license is an important milestone for Virgin Galactic, as is our first taxi test for our new spaceship. While we still have much work ahead to fully test this spaceship in flight, I am confident that our world-class team is up to the challenge.

Test flights are due to begin again shortly.
