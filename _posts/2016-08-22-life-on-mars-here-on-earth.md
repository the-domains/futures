Scientists will complete living on freeze-dried food and trying to avoid personal conflicts on the red planet-like slopes of Mauna Loa for a year.

US, French and German volunteers will complete living on freeze-dried food and trying to avoid personal conflicts on the red planet-like slopes of Mauna Loa for a year, to simulate life on Mars.

With limited resources, conducting research, working to avoid personal conflicts & Communication delays by 20 minutes, the length it would take to relay messages from Mars, the scientists have been tasked throughout the year to simulate life on Mars. This is the 2nd longest experimental simulation of its kind, the longest of over 500 days currently being held in Russia. 

They will complete this simulation this coming Sunday.
