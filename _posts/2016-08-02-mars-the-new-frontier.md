# Mars, The New Frontier 

Ever since the moon landing, man has looked beyond the bonds of Earth and to Mars, yet after so long, why aren't we there yet?

> Getting to Mars is a really hard thing to do - Dr Bill Barry, Chief Historian, Nasa

Just 17 years after man's first successes at space travel and the moon touch down by Neil Armstrong, Viking 1 made Mars; although not the first, Russia beat them to the touch down, however, with only 20 seconds contact, it was like landing a fly on a bug zapper and saying he had conquered it. Skip forward to 2016, 40 years later, Mars is only marginally closer. Mars is a tricky one though, Mars varies in distance from Earth, and due to the mechanics of planets rotating around a sun, Mars is only ever in a suitable position for Earth based missions every 18-24 months. 2016, though, shows hope of a major break through, Mars One mission, however Sceptical I may be of this, SpaceX & Red Dragon due to be announced later this year for 2018 test flight, and of course NASA & Orion. SpaceX currently lead the race to Mars, and is due to announce latest development plans for the MCT (Mars Colonial Transport) in September, launching in 2022, with a Manned Mars Mission in 2024\.

For the first time in 40 years, we have become in walking distance of Mars, and while satellites circle Pluto and Jupiter, Man will very soon walk on Mars, and look out at the universe and plan their next endeavour.
