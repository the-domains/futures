# Moon:2017

US grants its first clearance for a private flight to the moon. First step towards commercial space.

The FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation today granted clearance for the first ever commercial space flight to the moon. Moon Express is wanting to land a private robotic lander on the moon in 2017, containing experiments and cremated remains.

While this approval requires no new laws to be passed, it is a significant step forward for private companies in space. However, NASA will advise the company throughout the mission.

This move is a milestone for private enterprises in Space, and is a step SpaceX, and other companies were hoping for. SpaceX will require the same approvals for their Mars:2018 landing and this is one step SpaceX will be glad is cleared now.

Until now, getting approvals have been a lengthy process, but following this decision, this will become just another formality on our goal outwards.
