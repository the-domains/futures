Nasa sends out invites for the Journey to Mars Showcase on August 18th

Nasa are continuing their press promoting for Orion and SLS with a Journey to Mars Showcase on the 18th of August 2016\.

The day will begin at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, where the core stage of the SLS rocket and parts of the Orion Spacecraft are being manufactured, and will end the day at a test firing of SLS's powerful RS-25 engine at the agency's Stennis Space Center, near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi.

Media will also get the opportunity to

* get a behind-the-scenes look at what NASA is doing in science, technology, and human spaceflight to prepare for deep space travel
* view manufacturing of the core stage, the largest part of NASA's new deep space rocket
* see the next Orion structure being manufactured -- the Orion that will be used for structural testing of the design which will take humans beyond Earth orbit
* speak with representatives from NASA and industry partners creating the capabilities to send humans to Mars
* witness a firing of the RS-25 engine, part of the SLS core stage
* tour rocket engine facilities at Stennis
* visit the B-2 test stand that is being renovated for SLS core stage testing
