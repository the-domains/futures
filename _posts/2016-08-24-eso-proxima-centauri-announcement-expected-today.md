# ESO Proxima Centauri announcement expected today

Eso are expected to confirm the findings of Earth Like Proxima Centauri Exo Planet today. Breaking News Shortly

(updated)

Proxima B is announced as the first exoplanet capably of harbouring life, or did at some stage. Proxima B orbits around Proxima Centauri, a red dwarf, and could still look very similar to earth. Located in the habitable zone, Proxima B is an ideal planet to have surface liquid water, and could support life.

Scientists are keen to investigate more and hope in future high specification telescopes, like the James Webb Telescope, Hubbles replacement, and even deep space probe missions in the next few decades can confirm their findings. Are we alone? We may just be a little bit less alone than we were when we awoke this morning.
