SES and SpaceX announced today they have reached an agreement to launch SES-10 on a re-used Falcon 9 rocket booster.

> Having been the first commercial satellite operator to launch with SpaceX back in 2013, we are excited to once again be the first customer to launch on SpaceX's first ever mission using a flight-proven rocket. We believe reusable rockets will open up a new era of spaceflight, and make access to space more efficient in terms of cost and manifest management," said Martin Halliwell, Chief Technology Officer at SES

The first flight of the reused falcon9 is scheduled for launch in Q4 2016\. SES-10 will be the first-ever satellite to launch on a SpaceX flight-proven rocket booster.
