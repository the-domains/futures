# Ceramic Space Rockets

Temperatures of space craft have always been an issue engineers have had to overcome, however, a new solution may be about to appear.

Tomsk State University in Russia, are developing a solution similar to that of the underneath of the Space Shuttle, a Ceramic Rocket! A Ceramic compound whose multiple layers (based on hafnium carbide, zirconium diboride and zirconium oxide) can survive temperatures over 3,000C, over 1,000C higher temperatures that the current metal alloys can handle.

Durability of all parts of a space rocket is essential, and can lead to more powerful rockets helping space crafts reaching further into the cosmos.
