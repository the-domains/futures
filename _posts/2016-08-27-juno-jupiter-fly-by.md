After a journey of more than 5 years, Nasa's Juno Probe is preparing for its closest rotation of Jupiter

After a journey of more than 5 years, Nasa's Juno Probe is preparing for its closest rotation of the planet, allowing Juno to get its detailed look at Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system.

Juno will pass Jupiter at just 4200km above the cloud tops; the closest any space craft has ever got. Juno will have all its instruments and cameras switch on allowing scientists to get their most detailed information about Jupiter's clouds and below.

Juno will be moving at a speed of 208,000km/h and will be sweeping from the North to South of the planet.

The First Images have now been released by Nasa.
